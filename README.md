# Mimic Panic v1.0.0
Every item you touch might betray you. From junk to valuables, anything you grab can twist, shriek, and turn into something hungry. Pickups are now tiny panic attacks waiting to happen.

**All clients need this mod installed or it will not sync correctly.**

## What This Mod Does
Mimic Panic makes both items and valuables dangerous. Whenever you grab something, there is a chance it transforms into an enemy.
Default chance is set to 5%. Adjust Config if you want to adjust.

Nothing you pick up is safe.  
Nothing.

## How to Use It
Grab things and pray they stay things.  
If they do not, run or hunt.

## Config Options
